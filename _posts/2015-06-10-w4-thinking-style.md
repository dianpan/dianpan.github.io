Going through an intensive bootcamp where the pressure to absorb as much information as possible is high and time is low, it's important to understand the best way I learn so that I can adapt appropriately.

I took Anthony Gregorc's [quiz]("http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html") to learn about my learning style.

Here's a short explanation of each thinking styles:

1. Concrete sequential thinkers are based in reality, according to SuperCamp co-founder and president
Bobbi DePorter. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way. To them, "reality consists of what they can detect through their physical sense of sight, touch, sound, taste and smell. They notice and
recall details easily and remember facts specific information, formulas and rules with ease. 'Hands on' is a
good way for these people to learn." If you're concrete sequential—a CS—build on your organisational
strengths. Provide yourself with details. Break your projects down into specific steps. Set up quiet work
environments.

2. Concrete random thinkers are experimenters. says DePorter: "Like concrete sequentials, they're based in
reality, but are willing to take more of a trial-and-error approach. Because of this, they often make the
intuitive leaps necessary for true creative thought. They have a strong need to find alternatives and do things
in their own way." If you're a CR, use your divergent thinking ability. Believe that it's good to see things from
more than one viewpoint. Put yourself in a position to solve problems. But give yourself deadlines. Accept
your need for change. Try and work with people who value divergent thinking.
3. Abstract random thinkers organise information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured,
people-oriented environments. Says DePorter: "The 'real' world for abstract random learners is the world of
feelings and emotions. The AR's mind absorbs ideas, information and impressions and organises them
through reflection. They remember best if information is personalised. They feel constricted when they're
subjected to a very structured environment." If you're an AR, use your natural ability to work with others.
Recognise how strongly emotions influence your concentration. Build on your strength of learning by
association. Look at the big picture first. Be careful to allow enough time to finish the job. Remind yourself to
do things through plenty of visual clues, such as coloured stickers pasted up where you'll see them.

4. Abstract sequential thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought. They like to think in concepts
and analyse information. They make great philosophers and research scientists. DePorter again: "It's easy
for them to zoom in on what's important, such as key points and significant details. Their thinking processes
are logical, rational and intellectual. A favourite activity for abstract sequentials is reading, and when a
project needs to be researched they are very thorough at it. Generally they prefer to work alone rather than
in groups." If you're an AS, give yourself exercises in logic. Feed your intellect. Steer yourself toward highly
structured situations.


**My Results:**
I lean heavily towards a *Concrete Random* thinker, followed closely by *Abstract Random*.

This makes sense, why I'm natually attracted to methodical people, because I lack that intuition.  Why I've gotten a lot of feedback when I first started coding, that I was "all over the place."

I care deeply about doing, hacking, producing results, getting shit done.

BUT I despise working on things that I have no emotional attachment to. For example, our solo coding projects involved implementing BINGO boards and win logic. I'm pretty sure I didn't even play BINGO growing up and I had no interest whatsoever in creating that game.  On the other hand, I dedicated myself fully in group projects with my Accountability Group, and poured hours refactoring my website, first to make it mobile responsive and second to implement the Jekyll framework.

My challenge going into Phase 1, is finding a way to attach passion and emotion to projects that I initally find boring.  I think working with other people in a group setting will inspire more interest than working remotely in Phase 0.
