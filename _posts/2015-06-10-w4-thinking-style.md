Going through an intensive bootcamp where the pressure to absorb as much information as possible is high and time is low, it's important to understand the best way I learn so that I can adapt appropriately.

I took Anthony Gregorc's [quiz]("http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html") to learn about my learning style.

**Results**
I lean heavily towards a *Concrete Random* thinker, followed closely by *Abstract Random*.

This makes sense, why I'm natually attracted to methodical people, because I lack that intuition.  Why I've gotten a lot of feedback when I first started coding, that I was "all over the place."

I care deeply about doing, hacking, producing results, getting shit done.

BUT I despise working on things that I have no emotional attachment to. For example, our solo coding projects involved implementing BINGO boards and win logic. I'm pretty sure I didn't even play BINGO growing up and I had no interest whatsoever in creating that game.  On the other hand, I dedicated myself fully in group projects with my Accountability Group, and poured hours refactoring my website, first to make it mobile responsive and second to implement the Jekyll framework.

My challenge going into Phase 1, is finding a way to attach passion and emotion to projects that I initally find boring.  I think working with other people in a group setting will inspire more interest than working remotely in Phase 0.
