Big O notation is used to classify algorithms by how their runtime changes relative to the input, as the input grows arbitrarily large. Runtime is defined by time and space complexity.

Below are some common run times:

* O(1): a constant-time method
  - the algorithm will always execute in the same time regardless of its input size.
* O(N): a linear-time method
  - the algorithm will grow linearly with its input size
* O(N^2): a quadratic-time method
  - the algorithm will execute proportional to the square of the size of its input data
  - nested iterations will be O(N^3) or O(N^4)
* O(2^N): exponential-time method
  - execution time will double with each additional element in the input data
* O(log N): logarithmic-time method
