This is my wrap up post on phase 1.
note: I chose to repeat phase 1

The good:
-when you speak like you know what you're saying
-when you see code an
-NOT using each method, um hello vast collection of ennumerables we can use instead

The bad:
-putting insane amounts of pressure on yourself when you are not up to par with your cohortmates (phase 1 #1)
-feeling moments of resent towards your cohortmates when you think they should be putting in more effort (phase 1 #2)
- feeling like you are the only one asking questions (note: ignore that and keep asking questions)

The ugly:
- you will interact with cohortmates that have many skill levels and personalities.  Notice how you respond to each scenario, it's a pretty fascinating reflection on my own personality.
