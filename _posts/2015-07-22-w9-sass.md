In week 3 of DBC, we were asked to code a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.  That was probably the most frustrating week of my life (*dramatic* I know) mostly due to CSS being horribly painful to a new coder. Especially if you're just mucking around not really knowing how to structure your CSS or what best practices to follow. Now that I'm in week 9, *and the last week of Phase 0*, we were asked to refactor our sites using a framework like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).  I chose to redo my site pulling in the Jekyll framework.  Why Jekyll is awesome will come in a different blog post, but through Jekyll I came upon a sexy little CSS compiler called *Sass*.  Which has helped me remember why I love web design again.

# What is Sass you ask?
Well, straight from the horse's mouth, aka [Hampton Catlin](http://www.hamptoncatlin.com/), he says "think of it as mixing rocket fuel with your CSS and strapping it to a skateboard while pushing it down a hill" (*and I thought I was dramatic*).  BUT it turns out every bit of CSS from it's use of wonderful color manipulation to freakin well organized CSS code, I'm a fan.

# 5 things to love about Sass
1. CSS is a subclass of Sass, meaning just writing CSS means you're also writing Sass!
2. Stay DRY my friends - you can create variables and reuse them across your stylesheets
2. you can do crazy color manipulation like [this](http://s.codepen.io/boomerang/bcf312ac50be7dee42d1f1133e07c69e1437591717016/index.html#)
3. placeholder classes ```%placeholder```
4. CSS3 mixins
5. SO MUCH EASIER TO MAINTAIN!
