  <h1>Week 2: a closer look at CSS </h1>
  <h2>Phase 0, week 2</h2>
  <h4>5/31/15</h4>

  <section>

<p> A few topics to go over:<br>
  What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?


    This week we dove into HTML and CSS.  I have a lot of experience with HTML from my day job as an email marketer.  Email is unfortunately very archaic, meaning it will only accept HTML and in-line CSS.
