      Going into DBC, I really didn’t know what to expect with the new hybrid offsite/onsite approach. Now that week 1 is coming to an end, I’ve been really impressed so far with how well thought out and high quality the curriculum is.  I’ve learned how to navigate through the command line, push new code onto github, understand version control and get git working.  Week 1 has also been eye opening, I didn’t realize how much time Phase 0 actually took, and I need to make sure I don’t short change myself by not dedicating enough time to all of the material.

      I’ve enjoyed every single Shereef video I’ve seen so far, and this one was no exception.  He brings up 2 important topics that hit home:
      1. He talks about a restaurant vs a chef in the kitchen approach.  I see myself having the restaurant approach a lot.  I work hard for my money so I expect to get what I pay for.  The danger of that belief is that I become entitled and not willing to put in any work.  Once I change that mindset and think of myself as an integral part of the process, magic can happen.
      2. Imposter syndrome and fearing
      Fearing everyone is so much better than you and fear that you are too good for this program compared to your cohort mates.  I feel a little bit of both.
      He pretty much put things in perspective by saying the difference between someone brand new and someone with more experience is very small.
