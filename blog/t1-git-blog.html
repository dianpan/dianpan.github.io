  <h1>Week 1: an intro to git, Github and the command line</h1>
  <h2>Phase 0, week 1</h2>
  <h4>5/23/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Week 1 covered 3 main topics:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>git</li>
        <li>Github</li>
        <li>the command line</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    </p>
    git and GitHub are not the same thing, what?! git lives locally on your computer while GitHub is an online platform where you can share your repositories and updated code pushes with other people. It keeps a working version of your code that you can share publicly with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most important reasons to use git and Github is version control. Version control means keeping track of all of your changes to a specific file, project, etc. through making copies of said file throughout each change. Github is a nice place to keep all of those versions in one place, where you or others can access all of the past and current version.
    <br>
    Developers use version control to hedge against mistakes and lost work. If a mistake is made, they can go back to a bug free, working version of their code. It saves time and money and makes perfect sense to me. I wish I had started using git for my own work. Iâ€™ve written over my email code many times before. I save different files locally on my computer, and its a mess to sort through.
