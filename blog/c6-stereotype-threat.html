  <h1>Cultural Blog #6: Stereotype/Threats</h1>
  <h2>Phase 0, Week 6</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      This week I researched around the topic of stereotype threat.  Per Wikipedia:
      ```
      Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.
      ```
      <p>
      I'm sure everyone has felt stereotype threat from time to time.  For example, I'm Chinese, my family are first generation immigrants.  My parents have English accents, cook traditional Chinese food and don't behave like American parents. Growing up, I tried desperately to blend in with my American classmates.  I think Asians suffer from the "model minority" steryotype.  Quick definition below:

        ```A model minority is a minority group (whether based on ethnicity, race or religion) whose members are most often perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. This success is typically measured in income, education, low crime rates and high family stability. The term is highly controversial, for it is sometimes used to suggest there is no need for government action to reduce discrimination.
      ```

      It's hard to find your place when you don't always fit those model minority steryotypes. For example, there is a steryotype that Asians are good at math. My parents were great at math, me... not so much. They didn't understand why I wasn't good at math and I questioned it too. Like maybe it's because I'm not really that smart. So those first bouts of self doubt took root. To be clear, I don't think I'm bad at math, I was just more interested in reading and literature. But I do think that mindset, growing up with the perception that I wasn't good at math, did keep me away from STEM majors and professions in college and post. Which is why, it's pretty [ironic, funny, awesome] that I am now leaving my nice Marketing gig to pursue code. I think that act in itself is breaking the down some of my stereotype threats. I'm looking forward to sharing my story once I finish DBC and start a new career in web development! *fist pump*
